# Academic-discipline-testing

The purpose of this work is to develop a web application with which students could pass the necessary tests in academic disciplines, and teachers would receive data on the results of the tasks of each student.
For development, the programming language PHP, hypertext markup language HTML and CSS stylesheets were used. To implement storage of information about test results and user data, I choose a program for working with spreadsheets - Microsoft Excel.
